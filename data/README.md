# Data

This folder contains small, non-sensitive datasets used for development and testing.

Includes:
- Sample raw payloads and fixtures
- Golden datasets for repeatable tests
- Simulator configs (schema versions, change scenarios)

Rules:
- No real production or sensitive data.
- Keep datasets small and reproducible.
- When fixtures change, document why and update related tests.
