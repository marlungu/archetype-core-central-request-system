# Documentation

This folder contains the design and operational documentation for the
Archetype Core | Central Request System.

Start here:
- `problem-brief.md` — the authoritative description of the business problem,
  system guarantees, boundaries, and intended use.

Additional documents in this folder explain how the system is designed,
operated, and evolved over time.

Structure:
- `problem-brief.md` — why this system exists and what it is responsible for
- `architecture.md` — system components and data flow
- `adr/` — Architecture Decision Records documenting major design choices
- `runbooks/` — operational procedures for failures and recovery

Principles:
- Documentation explains intent and tradeoffs before implementation details.
- Changes to system behavior should be accompanied by doc updates.
- Clarity and restraint are preferred over exhaustive detail.
