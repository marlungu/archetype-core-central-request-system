# UI

This folder contains the operator and consumer console for the platform.

Purpose:
- Provide a simple way to search and inspect requests
- Make it easy to validate deduplication and classification outcomes
- Support investigation during incidents (what changed, when, and why)

Non-goals:
- This is not a full analytics dashboard.
- This is not an admin workflow tool.
- This is a lightweight console for inspection and confidence.
